# Combine_GWAS_Results_from_GAPIT

R script that combines all GWAS results in a directory for all traits generated by GAPIT and writes two files, one with all marker info and one with marker info for significantly associated markers only.

First file contains info that could be used to generate Manhattan plots. The second file contains info that could be used to only visualize QTL.
